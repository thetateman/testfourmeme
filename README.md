# CHANGES - 19/09/2024

## TokenManager(V1) & TokenManager2(V2)

- These smart contracts are designed for creating new tokens and executing trades.
- The old TokenManager (referred to as V1) still functions for trading tokens that have already been created but cannot create new tokens; It is only used to support the buying and selling of tokens created before the TokenManager2 (referred to as V2) deployment.
- If full support four.meme is needed, both TokenManager V1 and V2 should be supported.
- If you only wish to support tokens created after September 5, 2024, then only V2 TokenManager needs to be supported.
- The method for simultaneously supporting both V1 and V2 TokenManagers is as follows:
    - First, use the TokenManagerHelper method getTokenInfo to get the token information.
    - Check information if the token was created by V1 that the tradings should be processed through the interfaces of old V1 TokenManager. Otherwise, use the V2 version.
    - If pre-calculations of trading are needed, call helper methods.

## TokenManagerHelper3 (V3)

- This smart contract is a wrapper of the TokenManagers. It is designed for getting token information and performing pre-calculations easily.
- The old TokenManagerHelper (referred to as V1/V2) still works but we have provided a new TokenManagerHelper3 (referred to as V3) contract that unifies the information query interfaces for both V1 TokenManager and V3 TokenManager.
- We recommend users who have previously used V1/V2 helper to migrate to V3 helper. it supports tokens created by both TokenManager V1 and V2.
  

# Protocol Interfaces
